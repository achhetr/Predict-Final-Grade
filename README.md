# Predict Final Grade

This project was completed to showcase an understanding of Data Science Project using Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm.

Linear Regression ML was used to predict the final grade of students.

Conclusion: We compared the base model using all attributes and tuned model using only highly correlated independent attribute. We evaluated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of both the model. Hence, based on RMSE we can states that the base model performed better.

## Future work: 

### Data sets can be further tuned by cleaning:

- Previous failed students
- We can explore the relationship between previously failed student vs final grade
