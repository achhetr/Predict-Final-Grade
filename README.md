## Predict-Final_Grade

This project was complete to showcase understanding of Data Science Project using Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm.

Linear Regression ML was used to predict final grade of students. 

Conclusion:
We compared base model using all attributes and tuned model using only highly correlated independant attribute. We evaluated
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of both the model. Hence, based on RMSE we can states that the base model performed better.


Future work:
Data sets can be further tuned by cleaning:
- Previous failed students
- We can explore relationaship between previous failed student vs final grade
